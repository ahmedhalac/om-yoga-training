    question: 'What is yoga?',
    answer: `In simple terms, yoga is a system that combines physical postures, breathing exercises, meditation, and much more to cultivate balance in the body and mind. 
      It originated in ancient India and has evolved over thousands of years to encompass a wide range of styles and approaches. <br>
      What makes yoga truly unique is its flexibility; for some, yoga is a form of relaxation, a therapy for healing. 
      For others, a rigorous workout, a spiritual journey, or a combination of these and more. 
      Whether you prefer a vigorous flow or a gentle meditative class, yoga is a journey of self-discovery where you define your goals, and yoga becomes the means to achieve them.`,

    answer: `Yoga offers a myriad of physical benefits that include enhancing flexibility, preventing injuries, and helping with pain management. 
      Yoga also aids in recovery by improving circulation, easing muscle tension, and enhancing the body's natural healing processes.

      Regular practice can lead to better sleep, increased energy levels, and a heightened sense of vitality. <br>
